    <h1>1. What Is JavaScript?</h1>
    <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/images/javascript/javascript_logo.png" alt="JavaScript" width="32" height="32">
    <p>
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
        conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing,
        prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
        multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
        programming styles.

    <h1>2.What Is React.js </h1>
    <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/reactjs/images/reactjs-tutorial.png" alt="React.js" width="32" height="32">
    <p>
    <p>ReactJS is JavaScript library used for building reusable UI components. According to React official
        documentation, following is the definition −

        React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI
        components, which present data that changes over time. Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. React abstracts
        away the DOM from you, offering a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also render on the
        server using Node, and it can power native apps using React Native. React implements one-way reactive data flow,
        which reduces the boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.</p>

    <h1>3. What Is Ruby on Rails ?</h1>
    <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/ruby/images/ruby-tutorial.png" alt="Ruby" width="32" height="32">
    <p>Ruby on Rails or also known as rails is a server-side web application development framework that is written in
        the Ruby programming language, and it is developed by David Heinemeier Hansson under the MIT License. It
        supports MVC(model-view-controller) architecture that provides a default structure for database, web pages, and
        web services, it also uses web standards like JSON or XML for transfer data and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for
        the user interface. It emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering pattern and paradigms like:
        <br />
        Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY): It is a principle of software development to reducing the repetition of information
        or codes.
        <br />
        Convention Over Configuration (CoC): It provides many opinions for the best way to do many things in a web
        application.

    <h1>4.What Is Node.Js?</h1>
    <img src="https://www.javatpoint.com/js/nodejs/images/node-js-tutorial.png" alt="Node.js" width="32" height="32">
    <p>Node.js (Node) is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. Node is used
        extensively for server-side programming, making it possible for developers to use JavaScript for client-side and
        server-side code without needing to learn an additional language. Node is sometimes referred to as a programming
        language or software development framework, but neither is true; it is strictly a JavaScript runtime.</p>
